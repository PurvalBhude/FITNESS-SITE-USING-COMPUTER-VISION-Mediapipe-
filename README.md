# Exercise Angle and Count Tracker

## Overview

The Exercise Angle and Count Tracker is a web-based application designed to help users monitor their exercise form and count repetitions. By leveraging the MediaPipe library and OpenCV, this project provides real-time feedback on the angle of exercise movements and tracks the number of repetitions performed. The user interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Real-time Angle Calculation:** Calculates the angle of exercise movements to ensure proper form.
- **Repetition Counting:** Counts the number of completed exercises based on detected movements.
- **User Interface:** Interactive web-based UI created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **MediaPipe:** For pose detection and angle calculation.
- **OpenCV:** For image processing and manipulation.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** For building the web-based user interface.
